<p>In 1761, the method of trigonometric parallax was used to measure the distance to Venus, thereby calibrating the size of Kepler’s Solar System.  <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Bessel">Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel</a> measured the subtle annual shift in the position of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/61_Cygni">61 Cygni</a> (in 1862), where he combined the parallax method with his knowledge with the measured size of Earth’s orbit to discover that 61 Cyg is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\sim}650,000\ \rm AU\)</span> away (or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\sim}10\ \rm ly\)</span>; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\ {\rm ly} = 63,241\ {\rm AU}\)</span>).</p>
<p>Today, the surveyor’s method of trigonometric parallax can reach out past the Galactic center, or to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\sim}9.2\ \rm kpc\)</span> with the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)">Gaia telescope</a>.  Another method of distance determination was with the moving cluster method that made it possible to determine the distance to the Hyades cluster.  The technique of main-sequence fitting (or spectroscopic parallax) can be used to find the distances to open clusters out to about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7\ \rm kpc\)</span> by comparing their main sequences on an H-R diagram with that of the Hyades cluster.  The repeated application of a variety of methods using this pattern of calibration and measurement constitutes the steps of the <strong>extragalactic distance scale</strong>, or the <em>cosmological distance ladder</em>.</p>

<p>Spectroscopic parallax can (in principle) provide reliable distances to remote stars out to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\sim}7\ \rm Mpc\)</span> away, although in practice it is employed with in a few <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100\ \rm kpc\)</span> and is far enough to reach the Magellanic Clouds.  Some stars have specific feature in their spectra that allow their absolute magnitudes (and hence their distances) to be calculated.</p>
<p>For example, the K absorption line of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm Ca\)</span> can be quite broad, reaching maximum strength at spectral type <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm K0\)</span>.  In late-type stars with chromospheres (e.g., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G,\ K,\ \text{and } M\)</span> spectral types), a narrow emission line is seen, centered on the wide K absorption line.  The width of this emission line is strongly correlated with a star’s absolute visual magnitude, valid over a range of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(15\)</span> magnitudes, and called the <strong>Wilson-Bappu effect</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1957ApJ...125..661W/abstract">Wilson &amp; Vainu Bappu (1957)</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.1.3. </span>The Cepheid Distance Scale<a class="headerlink" href="#the-cepheid-distance-scale" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>For more distant objects, astronomers turn to the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period-luminosity_relation">period-luminosity relation</a> for Cepheids.  Before this relation could be used, it had to be calibrated by finding a classical Cepheid.  The nearest one (Polaris) was too far away (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\sim}200\ \rm pc\)</span>) for trigonometric parallax to be useful when the first calibrations were being performed in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>In 1913, Ejnar Hertzsprung used the Sun’s motion of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(16.5\ \rm km/s\)</span> with respect to the LSR to provide a longer baseline for parallax measurements.  It was this technique of <a class="reference external" href="https://saturnaxis.github.io/Cosmology/Chapter_25/milky-way-galaxy.html#some-methods-for-determining-distances">secular parallax</a> that enabled him to determine the average distance to a classical Cepheid with a period of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6.6\ \rm days\)</span>.  Hertzsprung then used this information to calibrate the period-luminosity relation, where Shapley carried out a similar procedure.  The distances to more Cepheids have been measured by parallax and other methods since then, and the period-luminosity relation has become well established.  Astronomer today use a period-luminosity relation in the form (<a class="reference external" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/709/1/120/pdf">Marengo et al. (2010)</a>)</p>

\end{align}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> accounts for the finite width of the instability strip on the H-R diagram.  Carroll &amp; Ostlie (2007) use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha = -3.53\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta = 2.13(B-V) - 5.66\)</span>, where Marengo et al. (2010) use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha = -3.37 \pm 0.06\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta = -5.65 \pm 0.02\)</span> in the K band.  In both cases, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> is the pulsation period in units of days, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B-V\)</span> refers to the color index.  For classical Cepheids <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B-V\approx 0.4\text{ to } 1.1\)</span>.  After the star’s absolute magnitude has been calculated, it can be combined with the star’s apparent magnitude to give its distance modulus.</p>
<p>Cepheid variable stars immediately proved their worth as stellar yardsticks.  It was in 1917 that Shapley measured the distances to Pop II Cepheids in globular clusters, thereby determining his estimates for the diameter of the Galaxy and the distance of the Sun from its center.  In 1923, Edwin Hubble discovered several Cepheid in M31 and announced that it was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(285\ \rm kpc\)</span> away.  It was Hubble’s series of observations that established M31 as an external galaxy, not a smaller nebula within the borders of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>The existence of a correlation between a Cepheid’s pulsation period and it absolute magnitude meant that these stars could be used as standard candles to determine distances many years <em>before</em> the physical processes that cause the pulsations were understood.</p>
<p>At the time, it was not known that 3 types of pulsating stars were used to determine the size of the Galaxy and the distance to M31.  Although the existence of interstellar dust clouds had been established, the existence of diffuse interstellar dust and gas capable of extinguishing starlight had not yet been demonstrated.  Leavitt’s variables in the Magellanic Clouds were classical Cepheids (Pop I stars), while those observed in the globular clusters by Shapely were W Virginis and RR Lyrae stars (both Pop II).</p>
<p>The W Viriginis stars are about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.5\ \text{mag}\)</span> fainter than classical Cepheids of the same period, which corresponds to a lower luminosity by a factor of 4.  After Hertzsprung and (later) Shapley calibrated the period-luminosity relation, they used nearby classical Cepheids but neglected the effect of extinction.  Neither realized that dust in the Galactic disk dimmed these stars by (coincidentally) about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.5\ \text{mag}\)</span>.</p>
<p>By chance the resulting period-luminosity relation was just about right when used with W Virginis stars.  However, it would give an underluminous result with classical Cepheids.  When Hubble used this calibration to determine the distance to M31, the apparent magnitudes of his Cepheids were correct but his estimates of the absolute magnitudes were too large.  Consequently, their distance module <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((m-M)\)</span> and the distances themselves were underestimated.  The stars were thought to be <strong>dimmer and closer</strong> rather than <em>brighter and farther away</em>, and so their parent galaxies were measured at roughly 1/2 of their actual distances <strong>and</strong> half their actual sizes.</p>
<p>Shapley fared no better with his observations of the (unknown to him) W Virginis stars in the globular clusters.  Although he unwittingly used the right variety of star for the calibration of the period-luminosity relation.  Extinction due to dust within the Galactic disk dimmed the starlight and increased the stars’ apparent magnitudes.  Because the importance of extinction was not yet recognized, Shapely incorrectly attributed his stars’ faintness to their remoteness.  As a result, his distances to the globular clusters were too great, as was the size he calculated for the Galaxy.</p>
<p>Something was obviously wrong.  It appeared that the Milky Way was much larger than any of the galaxies surveyed.  <a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1930LicOB..14..154T/abstract">Trumpler (1930)</a> showed that interstellar extinction could remedy part of the problem.  The rest of the puzzle was solved by <a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1956PASP...68....5B/abstract">Baade (1956)</a>, who showed that there are two types of Cepheids: (1) the classical Cepheids and (2) the intrinsically fainter W Virginis stars.  With these corrections, the measured distances and sizes of the other galaxies doubled and the Milky Way was reduced to a size that was a bit smaller than M31.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the calibration of the period-luminosity relation was carried out using data obtained by the Hipparcos mission.  Hipparcos astronomers measured the parallax angles of 273 Cepheids and used the resulting distances to derive the period-luminosity relation.  This was the first period-luminosity relation obtained from a direct distance measurement, and it is interesting that the result was nearly identical to an expression obtained by <a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1968ApJ...151..531S/abstract">Sandage &amp; Tammann (1968)</a>.  Although further adjustments are sure to follow Cepheids certainly provide a firm foundation measuring the distances to other galaxies.</p>
<p>Interstellar extinction is still the largest source of error when Cepheids are used as standard candles, and there may also be a weak dependence on metallicity.  The extinction problem can be reduced by observing these stars at IR wavelengths, since IR light more readily penetrates dusty regions.  Because Cepheids are about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\times\)</span> dimmer in the IR, astronomers have not stopped searching for them at visible wavelengths.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.1.4. </span>Supernovae as Distance Indicators<a class="headerlink" href="#supernovae-as-distance-indicators" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Supernovae can be used in several ways to measure extragalactic distances.  Suppose the angular extent <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta(t)\)</span> of a supernova’s photosphere is observed.  The angular velocity of the expanding gases <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\ (=\Delta \theta/\Delta t)\)</span> can be found by comparing two observations separated by a time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta t\)</span>.  If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> is the distance to the supernova, then the transverse velocity of the expanding photosphere is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\theta = \omega d\)</span>.</p>
<p>Assuming that the expansion is spherically symmetric, the transverse velocity should be equal to the ejecta’s radial velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{\rm ej}\)</span> obtained from the supernova’s Doppler-shifted spectral lines.  Then the distance to the supernova is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d= v_{\rm ej}/\omega\)</span>.</p>
<p>Most supernovae are too distant for the above method to be employed, where another strategy is adopted.  It assumes that the expanding shell of hot gases radiates as a blackbody.  Then the supernova’s luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law,</p>

\[ L = 4\pi \sigma R^2(t)T_{e}^4, \]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R(t)\)</span> is the radius of the expanding photosphere and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> is the age of the supernova.  If we assume that the ejecta’s radial velocity has remained nearly constant, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R(t) = v_{\rm ej}t\)</span>.  The effective temperature <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_e\)</span> of the photosphere comes from the characteristics of its blackbody spectrum.  Once the luminosity is found, it can be converted to an absolute magnitude and then used to find the distance to the supernova by comparing it with the apparent magnitude.</p>
<p>The photosphere of the expanding shell of a supernova is neither perfectly spherical nor a perfect blackbody.  Difficulties with accurate values for interstellar extinction plague both methods, but the problem is more acute for core-collapse supernovae (Types Ib, Ic, and II), which are found near sites of recent star formation.  Typical uncertainties in the distances obtained range from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(15-25\%\)</span> for M101 to the Virgo cluster of galaxies, respectively.</p>

<p>The most important way of using supernovae to measure distance takes advantage of the similarity of Type Ia light curves.  These supernovae have blue and visual absolute magnitudes of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\langle M_B \rangle \simeq \langle M_V \rangle \simeq -19.3 \pm 0.03\)</span> at maximum light.  If the peak magnitude of a Type Ia can be determined, its distance can also be determined.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fortunately there is a well-defined inverse correlation between a Type Ia’s maximum brightness and the rate of decline of its light curve, and astronomers learned to use this information to more precisely determine the supernova’s intrinsic peak luminosity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, a supernova is observed over time at several wavelengths.  The <strong>multicolor light curve shapes (MCLS) method</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9604143">Riess, Press, &amp; Kirshner (1996)</a>), then compares the shape of the light curve to a family of parameterized template curves that allows the absolute magnitude of the supernova at maximum brightness to be determined (even if the supernova was not caught at its peak brilliance).  The MLCS method also allows the reddening and dimming effect of interstellar dust to be detected and removed.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">7.1.5.1. </span>Using Novae in Distance Determinations<a class="headerlink" href="#using-novae-in-distance-determinations" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>From the sizes of their expanding photospheres, novae can be used in the same manner as supernovae to determine distances.  Although there is a wide variation in the absolute magnitudes of novae at peak light, there is a relation between a nova’s maximum visual magnitude <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_v^{\rm max}\)</span> and the time it takes for its visible light to decline by two magnitudes.  <em>Consequently, novae can serve as standard candles.</em></p>
<p>The physical reason why this relationship holds for novae is that more massive, smaller white dwarfs produce greater compression and heating of the accreted gases on their surfaces.  A runaway thermonuclear reaction may be initiated with a smaller accumulated mass.  The less massive surface layers are more readily ejected, and the nova declines more rapidly.  The average rate of decline over the first <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\ \rm mag\)</span> is written as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\dot{m}\)</span> (in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm mag/day\)</span>) and can be expressed as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[M_V^{\rm max} = -9.96 - 2.31 \log_{10}{\dot{m}}, \]</div>
<p>for Galactic novae, with an uncertainty of about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm 0.4\ \rm mag\)</span> (<a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985ApJ...292...90C/abstract">Cohen (1985)</a>; see <a class="reference external" href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Jacoby/Jacoby5_3.html">here</a> for details).  After fading two magnitudes, the brightest novae are about as luminous as the brightest Cepheids, which means that these two methods reach to about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(20\ \rm Mpc\)</span> or just past the Virgo cluster.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>There are several variants for the rate of decline for novae, which use time to decline by a given magnitude (e.g., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\ \rm mag\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\ \rm mag\)</span>, etc.).

<h3><span class="section-number">7.1.6. </span>Secondary Distance Indicators<a class="headerlink" href="#secondary-distance-indicators" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Supernovae are unpredictable and somewhat rare occurrences for a given galaxy, where astronomer must use <em>secondary</em> methods to measure the distance to more remote galaxies.  These secondary distance indicators require a galaxy with an established distance for their calibration.</p>
<p>One way of seeing farther involves using the brightest objects in a galaxy.  For example, the three brightest giant H II regions in a galaxy can be used as a standard candle.  These regions are visible at great distances, and may contain up to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^9\ M_\odot\)</span> of ionized hydrogen.</p>
<p>Measurements of the angular sizes of the H II regions and the apparent magnitude of the galaxy can be compared with similar measurements for other galaxies with known distances.  This makes it possible to calculate the H II regions’ linear sizes (in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm pc\)</span>), along with the galaxy’s absolute magnitude.  However, since the diameter of an H II region is difficult to define unambiguously, this procedure is relatively insensitive to distance and must be used carefully.</p>
<p>The brightest red supergiants seem to have about the same absolute visual magnitude in all galaxies.  Apparently, mass loss reduces the brightest red supergiants to the same maximum mass, which results in their having about the same luminosity.  Sampling a number of galaxies revealed the average visual magnitude of the three brightest red stars to be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_V = -8.0\)</span>.  Because individual stars must be resolved for this method, its range is the same as for spectroscopic parallax, or about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7\ \rm Mpc\)</span>.</p>

The best results are achieved with galaxies have large numbers of globular clusters (e.g., giant ellipticals).

<p>The appeal of the Tully-Fisher method of distance determination lies in its accuracy (typically <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm 0.4\ \rm mag\)</span> in the IR) and its great range (as far as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100\ \rm Mpc\)</span>).

<p>The Tully-Fisher method has been applied to 161 spiral galaxies belonging to the Virgo cluster, which resulted in producing a 3D map of the cluster and that the Virgo cluster extends along the line-of-sight about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\times\)</span> its diameter on the sky.</p>

<p>Just as the brightest H II regions or the brightest red supergiants have been used to determine the distance to individual galaxies, the brightest galaxy in a cluster can be used to obtain the cluster’s distance.</p>
<p>From a composite luminosity function, we can see a sharp decline in the function at the bright end (more negative <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span>), which indicates that the absolute magnitude of the brightest galaxy can be determined with some accuracy.  The average value of the absolute visual magnitude for the brightest galaxy in ten nearby clusters is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_V = -22.83 \pm 0.61\)</span>, where this is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.2\)</span> magnitudes brighter than a Type Ia supernova at peak brilliance and in principle, this method should reach <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\times\)</span> farther than with supernovae (to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(&gt;4000\ \rm Mpc\)</span>).</p>

<p>The danger in using this method is that galaxies and galaxy cluster both evolve.  For example, the brightest galaxy in a contemporary cluster may not have existed in its present form billions of years ago.  The giant cD galaxies often found at the centers of reich clusters are probably the result of galactic mergers.  Using a general galaxy luminosity function calibrated with nearby clusters may not be appropriate for very distant, and consequently younger-looking clusters.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">7.2. </span>The Expansion of the Universe<a class="headerlink" href="#the-expansion-of-the-universe" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>In the early 1900s, astronomers began making systematic observations of the galactic radial velocities by measuring their Doppler-shifted spectral lines.  It was hoped that if the motions of these objects were found to be random, then the Sun’s motion in the Milky Wya should be related to the vector sum of the radial velocities of the spiral nebulae.</p>
<p>It was <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesto_M._Slipher">Vesto Slipher</a> who first discovered that this plan was doomed to failure.  The velocities of the spiral nebulae were <em>not</em> random.  Instead, most of the spectra showed redshifted spectral lines.  Slipher announced in 1914 that most of the 12 galaxies he surveyed were rapidly moving <em>away</em> from Earth, although M31’s blueshifted spectrum indicated it was approaching Earth at nearly <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(300\ \rm km/s\)</span>.  It was quickly realized that these galaxies were not <em>only</em> moving away from Earth but moving away from each other as well.</p>
<p>Astronomers began to talk about these galactic motions in terms of an expansion.  Meanwhile, Slipher continuted his measurements, and by 1925, he had examined <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(40\)</span> galaxies with spectra showing redshifted lines were much more common than those exhibiting blueshifts.  Slipher concluded that nearly every galaxy he examined was rapidly receding from Earth.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.2.1. </span>Hubble’s Law of Universal Expansion<a class="headerlink" href="#hubble-s-law-of-universal-expansion" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>In 1925, Hubble discovered Cepheid variable stars in M31, which established that the Andromeda “nebula” was in fact an external galaxy.  Hubble continued his search for Cepheids, while determining the distances to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(18\)</span> galaxies.  He combined his results with Slipher’s velocities and discovered tha a galaxy’s recessional velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> was proportional to its distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span>.  In 1929, Hubble presented his results in a paper at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences (<a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1929PNAS...15..168H/abstract">Hubble (1929)</a>), which included the relation,</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-67662b83-5499-4e07-8d85-239b86c6629d">
<span class="eqno">(7.4)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-67662b83-5499-4e07-8d85-239b86c6629d" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\begin{align}
v = H_o d.
\end{align}\]</div>
<p>This relation is today called <strong>Hubble’s law</strong>, where the proportionality constant is called the <strong>Hubble constant</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_o\)</span>.  The recessional velocity is usually given in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm km/s\)</span> and the distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm Mpc\)</span>, so Hubble’s constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_o\)</span> has units of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm km/s/Mpc\)</span>.</p>
<p>Hubble realized that he had discovered an exceptionally powerful method of finding distance to remote galaxies simply by measuring their redshifts.  his early results show a linear fit to a scattering of points on a graph of velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> vs. distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span>.  Hubble continued to compile distances and redshifts to strengthen this relationship, with much of the work done my his assistant, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_L._Humason">Milton Humason</a>.</p>
<p>Humason literally worked his up to the top at Mt. Wilson Observatory, where he started out as a mule packer when the observatory was begin constructed.  Then, he served as a restaurant busboy, janitor, and night assistant at Mt. Wilson.  After Humason gained permission to observe on the smaller telescopes, Hubble was so impressed with the results that Humason ended up as his assistant.  Humason exposed and measured most of the photographic plates himself.  By 1934, the distances and velocities of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(32\)</span> galaxies were obtained and the expansion of the universe became an observational feature of the universe.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the idea of a universal expansion was simultaneously being developed by theorists.  <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Sitter">Willem de Sitter</a> used Einstein’s theory of general relativity to describe a universe that was <strong>expanding</strong>.  Although de Sitter’s solution of Einstein’s equations described a vacuum (universe devoid of matter), it did predict a redshift that increased with the distance from the light’s origin.</p>
<p>Hubble was aware of de Sitter’s work, where Hubble referenced the expansion ast the de Sitter effect.  Other theorists later found additional solutions that also indicated a universal expansion, but astronomers were unaware of their results until 1930.  Einstein himself initially favored a <em>static</em> universe that was neither expanding nor contracting.  However, the observations of Hubble and Humason forced Einstein to abandon this view in 1930.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.2.2. </span>The Expansion of Space and the Hubble Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#the-expansion-of-space-and-the-hubble-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>To understand what <em>the expansion of the universe</em> really means, suppose that the Earth were to expand, doubling in size during an hour’s time.</p>
<p>Initially, Yellowstone National Park is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(500\ \rm km\)</span> from Salt Lake City; Albuquerque is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1000\ \rm km\)</span> away; and Minneapolis is at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2000\ \rm km\)</span>.  An hour later, each of these distances have doubled (e.g., Yellowstone is now <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1000\ \rm km\)</span>) so that a Salt Lake City resident would find Yellowstone drifted away at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(500\ \rm km/hr\)</span>, Albuquerque moved away at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1000\ \rm km/hr\)</span>, and Minneapolis receded at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2000\ \rm km/hr\)</span>.  Thus a recessional velocity that is proportional to distance is the natural result of an expansion that is both <strong>isotropic</strong> and <strong>homogenous</strong> (i.e., same in magnitude in every direction and at every location).  Observers in yellow stone, Albuquerque, and Minneapolis would arrive at the same conclusion.  Everyone involved in the expansion sees everyone else moving away with a velocity that obey’s Hubble’s law.</p>
<p>There is a vital distinction between the velocity of a galaxy through space (i.e., <strong>peculiar velocity</strong>) and its <strong>recessional velocity</strong> due to the expansion of the universe.  A galaxy’s recessional velocity is <em>not</em> due to its motion through space; instead the galaxy is being <em>carried</em> along with the surrounding space as the universe expands.  The motion of galaxies as they participate in the expansion of the universe is the <strong>Hubble flow</strong>.  In the same manner, a galaxy’s <strong>cosmological redshift</strong> is produced by the expansion as the wavelength of the light emitted by the galaxy is stretched along with the space through which the light travels.</p>
<p>For this reason, the cosmological redshift is not related to the galaxy’s recessional velocity by the Doppler shift equations.  Those equations were derived for a static, <em>Euclidean</em> spacetime and do not include the effects of the expanding, <em>curved</em> spacetime of our universe.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, astronomers frequently translate a measured redshift <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> into a radial velocity that a galaxy would have <em>if</em> it had a peculiar velocity instead of its actual recessional velocity.  For example, the statement that <em>quasar SDSS 1030+0524 appears to be moving away from us at more than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(96\%\)</span> of the speed of light</em> must be interpreted with the above caveat in mind.

<h3><span class="section-number">7.2.3. </span>The Value of the Hubble Constant<a class="headerlink" href="#the-value-of-the-hubble-constant" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>In principle, Hubble’s law can be used to find the distance to any galaxy whose redshift can be measured.  The stumbling block to carrying out this procedure has been the uncertainty in the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law">Hubble constant</a>.  Through the end of the 20th century, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_o\)</span> was known within a factor of two, between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(50-100\ \rm km/s/Mpc\)</span>.</p>
<p>Historically, the difficulty in determining the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_o\)</span> arose from using remote galaxies for its calibration.  A major source of the diverse values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_o\)</span> obtained by different researchers lay in their choice (and ues) of secondary distance indicators when measuring remote galaxies.  There are also large-scale motions of galaxies relative to the Hubble flow that are being sorted out.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a selection effect called a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malmquist_bias">Malmquist bias</a> that must be guarded against.  This can occur when using a magnitude-limited sample of objects, where objects brighter than a certain <em>apparent</em> magnitude are used.  At larger distances, only the intrinsically brightest objects will be included in the sample, which will skew the statistics unless corrected for.</p>
<p>To incorporate the uncertainty in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_o\)</span>, it is defined using a dimensionless parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> through the expression,</p>

<p>Since the universe is expanding, it must have been smaller in the past than it is now.  Imagine viewing a filmed history of the universe, watching the galaxies fly farther and farther apart.  Now run the film <em>backward</em>, in effect reversing the direction of time.  Seen in reverse, all of the galaxies are approaching on another.  According to the Hubble law, a galaxy twice as far away is approaching twice as fast.</p>
<p>The inescapable conclusion is that all of the galaxies (and all of space) will simultaneously converge to a single point.  As everything in the universe rapidly converged, it heated to extremely high temperatures.  The expansion of the universe from a single point is known as the <strong>Big Bang</strong>.</p>
<p>The hot early universe was filled with blackbody radiation, and as the universe expanded that radiation cooled to become the <strong>cosmic microwave background</strong> (CMB), which is seen through microwaves arriving from all directions in the sky.  Observations of the CMB provide convincing evidence for the hot Big Bang.  The <strong>Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe</strong> (WMAP) studied the fluctuations (anisotropies) of the CMB.  These first results in 2013 from WMAP ushered in a new era of precision cosmology.  The value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> determined by the WMAP data is</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.3.2. </span>The Local Group<a class="headerlink" href="#the-local-group" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>About 35 galaxies are know to like within roughly <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\ \rm Mpc\)</span> of the Milky Way.  This collection of galaxies is known as the <strong><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group">Local Group</a></strong>.  Its most prominent members are its three spiral galaxies: our Galaxy, M31, and M33 (in the constellation Triangulum).  The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are the next most luminous.  The remaining galaxies are dwarf ellipticals or dwarf spheroidals, which are very small and quite faint.</p>
<p>Many of the dwarf galaxies have accumulated around the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, which are on opposite sides of the Local Group (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\sim}770\ \rm kpc\)</span> apart).  Even at this distance, M31 is about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.5^\circ\)</span> wide on the sky or five time the Moon’s diameter.  In addition to the Magellanic Clouds, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(9\)</span> of the dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals are situated near the Milky Way.  All <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\)</span> spiral galaxies have warped disks.  In fact, the line of sight from Earth passes twice through some parts of the disk of M33.</p>
<p>The Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies are approaching each other with a <em>relative</em> velocity of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v = 119\ \rm km/s\)</span>. The gravitational attraction between them has overcome their tendency to expand along the Hubble flow.  As a result, they will collide in approximately <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5-6\ \rm Gyr\)</span>.  Indeed, the entire Local Group is still in a state of collapse.</p>
<p>Because the Milky Way and Andromeda dominate the Local Group (producing some <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(90\%\)</span> of its luminosity), their motion toward each other provides an opportunity to estimate their combined mass.  Assuming that the two galaxies were initially moving apart (following the Big Bang).  At some time in the past, their gravitational attraction halted and reversed their original recessional motion.  The Milky Way and M31 are therefore in orbit around on another with an eccentricity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e\simeq 1\)</span> (i.e., on a collision course).  From conservation of energy, the orbital speed and separation are related by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ v^2 = GM \left(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a}\right), \]</div>
<p>which depends on the total mass of the two galaxies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span>.  The orbits semimajor axis <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> is related to its period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> by Kepler’s third law:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}a^3. \]</div>
<p>Combining the orbital speed with Kepler’s third law allows us to eliminate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span>, which leads to</p>

v^2 - \frac{2GM}{r} + \left(\frac{2\pi}{P}GM \right)^{2/3} = 0.

<p>For the Milky Way and M31, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r= 770\ \rm kpc\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v = 119\ \rm km/s\)</span>.  To obtain the total mass <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span>, we need an estimate of the orbital period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span>.  When galaxies do meet in the future, they will have returned to their initial configuration, and one orbital period will have elapsed since the Big Bang.  Let’s use</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ P = t_H + t_c, \]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_c = r/v\)</span> is roughly the collision time.  This is an overestimate of the period because the Milky Way and M31 will <em>accelerate</em> as they approach their rendezvous.  Using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_{\rm WMAP} = 0.71\)</span> (or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_o = 71\ \rm km/s/Mpc\)</span>), the total mass is found to be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M = 7.9 \times 10^{42}\ \rm kg = 4 \times 10^{12}\ M_\odot\)</span>.</p>
<p>This estimate of the Local Group’s mass is much more than the luminous mass observed in these galaxies.  The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>-band luminosity of the Milky Way is about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.3 \times 10^{10}\ L_\odot\)</span> and M31 is roughly twice as bright.  Thus, the mass-to-light ratio is estimated to be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M/L = 57\ M_\odot/L_\odot\)</span>.  Because the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> was overestimated, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M/L\)</span> has been underestimated.  These numbers are much larger than the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M/L \simeq 3\ M_\odot/L_\odot\)</span> for the luminous matter in the Milky Way’s thin disk and central bulge.  Our WMAP result of for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M/L\)</span> is consistent with the estimates when the Milky Way’s dark matter halo is included.  Apparently, astronomers have seen <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\lesssim}10\%\)</span> of the matter that makes up the Milky Way and M31.</p>

<p>The <strong>Virgo cluster</strong> of galaxies was first recognized in the 18th century by William Herschel.  It is located where the constellations of Virgo and Coma Berenices meet.  The Virgo cluster covers a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^\circ \times 10^\circ\)</span> region of the sky.  The center of the cluster is located about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(16\ \rm Mpc\)</span> from Earth.</p>
<p>This rich, irregular cluster is a sprawling collection of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\sim}250\)</span> large galaxies and more than 2000 smaller ones, contained within a region of about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\ \rm Mpc\)</span> across.  At least seven of these galaxies display blueshifted spectral lines, as their peculiar velocities of approach overpower the receding Hubble flow.</p>
<p>The Virgo cluster is made up of all types of galaxies like most irregular clusters.</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><p>Roughly equal numbers of spirals and dwarf ellipticals are found within <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6\circ\)</span> of the cluster’s center, with ellipticals becoming increasingly common near the center.</p></li>

<p>The center of the Virgo cluster is dominated by three of the cluster’s four giant elliptical galaxies (M84, M86, and M87).

The gas loses energy by the fre-free emission of X-ray photons.  This thermal bremsstrahlung process produces a characteristic spectrum that can be readily identified and <strong>used to estimate the mass of the galaxy</strong>.</p>
<p>The analysis is complicated, but observations of the spectrum of the gas can provide an idea of how it temperature <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T(r)\)</span> and mass density <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho(r)\)</span> vary with radius <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>, the distance from the center of the galaxy.  The nearly spherical shape of M87 simplifies the geometry.  The gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium (to a good approximation), which means</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \frac{dP}{dr} = - \frac{GM_r \rho}{r^2}. \]</div>
<p>By substituting the ideal gas law for the pressure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span>, assuming a constant mean molecular weight <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>, and solving for the interior mass <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_r\)</span>, we can produce</p>

M_r = - \frac{kTr}{\mu m_H G}\left(\frac{\partial \ln \rho}{\partial \ln r} + \frac{\partial \ln T}{\partial \ln r}\right).
\end{align}\]</div>
<p>All of the quantities on the right-hand side can be roughly evaluated from observation of the X-rays emitted by the hot gas, and used to calculate the interior mass (both luminous and dark) on the left hand side.  <em>The derivatives are negative, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_r\)</span> is positive.</em></p>
<p>One result for M87 show that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_r\)</span> increases <em>linearly</em> with radius out to about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(300\ \rm kpc\)</span>.  This is the same signature seen for the distribution of dark matter in spiral galaxies.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The total mass contained within <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=300\ \rm kpc\)</span> is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_r \simeq 3 \times 10^{13}\ M_\odot\)</span>, with a central density of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.015\ M_\odot/pc^3\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The corresponding mass-to-light ratio is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M/L \simeq 750\ M_\odot/L_\odot\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is 250 times the mass-to-light ratio for the stars in the Milky Way’s Galactic bulge and think disk.  It also indicates that over <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(99\%\)</span> of M87’s mass is dark matter.</p>
<p>M87 is <em>not</em> a typical elliptical galaxy.  Studies of other elliptical galaxies have found that many of them also contain large amounts (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gtrsim 90\%\)</span>) of dark matter.</p>

<p>The nearest rich, regular galaxy cluster is the <strong>Coma cluster</strong>.

The Coma cluster is about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5.4\times\)</span> farther away than is the Virgo cluster (or about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(90\ \rm Mpc\)</span> from Earth).  The cluster’s angular diameter is about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4^\circ\)</span>, which corresponds to a linear diameter of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6\ \rm Mpc\)</span>.  The Coma cluster consists of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\sim}10,000\)</span> galaxies, where most of them are dwarf ellipticals that are too faint to be seen.  In a rich, regular cluster, the vast majority of the galaxies are ellipticals and S0 galaxies.

<p>The predominance of early-type galaxies in a cluster may be due to the increased likelihood of interactions (i.e., the morphology-density relation).  Perhaps (in the past)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>more spirals existed in the Coma cluster and other rich, regular clusters, but tidal interactions and mergers destroyed the spiral morphology, leaving behind ellipticals and S0 galaxies.</p></li>
<li><p>early-type galaxies may simply form as a result of hierarchical mergers of protogalaxies near the bottom of the cluster’s gravitational well, where dark matter would naturally tend to collect.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In support of the interaction view, the center of the very rich cluster <a class="reference external" href="https://sci.esa.int/web/hubble/-/15596-distant-galaxy-cluster-cl-0939-4713">CL 0939+4713</a>, with a redshift of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z= 0.41\)</span>, implying a distance of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1230/h = 1730\ \rm Mpc\)</span>.  We are seeing this cluster as it was about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4.0/h = 5.6\ \rm Gyr\)</span> ago, when many late-type spirals were found in this central region.  This is unlike the center of any high-density cluster belonging to the present epoch.  Most of the spirals in the cluster show at least some evidence of interaction.  The frequency of interactions and mergers is perhaps an order of magnitude greater than would be found in a contemporary rich cluster.</p>
<p>Looking at the remote cluster in the constellation Serpens at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\approx 1.2\)</span> (or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1970/h = 2770\ \rm Mpc\)</span>), we see it as it was about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6.4/h = 9\ \rm Gyr\)</span> ago.  It contains apparently mature ellipticals but very few normal spirals.  Instead, there is an abundance of odd galactic fragments having a bluish color, which is a signature of active star formation.  It is not clear whether these are the debris of former spirals, or spirals still in the process of coalescing.</p>

<p>in 1933 <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Zwicky">Fritz Zwicky</a> measured the radial velocities of galaxies in the Coma cluster from their Doppler-shifted spectra.

<p>Overall, the Coma cluster’s intensity profile <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I(r)\)</span> follows a characteristic <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r^{1/4}\)</span> law like those that describe the intensity profiles of the Milky Way’s bulge (and halo), and elliptical galaxies.

<p>A portion of Zwicky’s <em>missing mass</em> was discovered with the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Energy_Astronomy_Observatory_1">High Energy Astronomical Observatory</a> (HEAO) series of satellites that were first launched in 1977.  They revealed that many galaxy clusters emit X-rays from much of the cluster’s volume.  These satellites (together with optical observations) indicated that galaxy clusters contain an <strong>intracluster medium</strong> (ICM).  The intracluster medium has two components.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>A diffuse, irregular distribution of stars.</p></li>
<li><p>A hot <strong>intracluster gas</strong> that is distributed more or less homogenously, occupying the space between galaxies and filling the cluster’s gravitational potential well.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The X-ray luminosities range from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{36}-10^{38}\ \rm W\)</span>, with richer clusters shining more brightly in X-rays.  The core of the Virgo cluster contains about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5\times 10^{13}\ \rm M_\odot\)</span> of X-ray emitting gas, and the core of the Coma cluster holds <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 \times 10^{13}\ M_\odot\)</span>.

<p>The X-ray spectrum of the ICM also displays emission lines of highly ionized iron (e.g, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm Fe\ XXV\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm Fe\ XXVI\)</span>), silicon, and neon.  This indicates that the gas has been processed through the stars in the cluster’s galaxies, becoming enriched in heavy elements via stellar nucleosynthesis.</p>
<p><em>How did os much mass escape from the cluster’s galaxies?</em>  Mergers must have occurred more frequently in the early history of the cluster.  When the cluster was still forming during its first few billion years, it was more dispersed.  According to the virial theorem, the cluster’s galaxies would have been moving more slowly, thereby increasing the dynamical friction and the chance of a merger.</p>
<p>The large amounts of intracluster gas found in many rich clusters were probably ejected during these early galactic interactions, or by bursts of star formation.  Once this process was underway, it would have been enhanced by ram-pressure stripping.  When a galaxy moves at several <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1000\ \rm km/s\)</span> through the intracluster gas, it encounters a furious wind that is capable of stripping its gas away.</p>

<p>Next in the hierarchy of galactic clustering is the <strong>supercluster</strong>, which is a clustering of clusters on a scale of up to about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100\ \rm Mpc\)</span>.  The Virgo cluster is near the center of the <strong>Local Supercluster</strong>.  This disk of clusters has the shape of a flattened ellipsoid (i.e., a pancake) that contains most of the galaxies lying within about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(20\ \rm Mpc\)</span> of the Virgo cluster.</p>
<p>Two of the most prominent superclusters are the Perseus-Pisces and the Hydra-Centaurus supercluster, which are named for the constellations in which it is found.  The Perseus-Pisces supercluster is about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(50/h\ \rm Mpc\)</span> away and has a threadlike appearance.  It is a planar, filamentary structure that is about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(40/h\ \rm Mpc\)</span> long.  The Hydra-Centaurus supercluster is at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(30/h\ \rm Mpc\)</span> in roughly the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Because the Local Group resides near the edge of the Local Supercluster, it might be expected that the supercluster’s gravitational pull would be detectable.  In 1958, de Vaucouleurs found that the Local Group is moving away less rapidly from the Virgo cluster than would be expected solely from the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>At a distance of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(16\ \rm Mpc\)</span>, a pure Hubble flow would produce a recessional velocity of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v= H_od = 1600/h\ \rm km/s\)</span>.  The difference between the actual velocity of the Local Group relative to the Virgo cluster and the Hubble flow is called the <strong>Virgocentric peculiar velocity</strong> of the Local Group and is estimated to be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(168 \pm 50\ \rm km/s\)</span> <a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJ...365....1S/abstract">(Sandage &amp; Tammann (1990))</a>.</p>
<p>A similar argument used for the approaching paths of the Milky Way and M31 can now be invoked to estimate the mass-to-light ratio of the Local Supercluster.  The results show that the supercluster’s mass is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\sim}8/h \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot\)</span>.  The corresponding mass-to light ratio is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M/L \simeq 400/h\ M_\odot/L_\odot\)</span>, which provides more evidence for a preponderance (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(&gt;50%\)</span> probability) of dark matter.</p>

<p>The Virgocentric peculiar velocity is a minor perturbation in a much larger scale inhomogeneity in the Hubble flow.  There is a large-scale streaming motion (relative to the Hubble flow) that carries the Milky Way, the Local Group, the Virgo cluster, and thousands of other galaxies through space in the direction of the constellation Centaurus.</p>
<p>The peculiar velocity of the Local Group relative to the Hubble flow is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(627\ \rm km/s\)</span>.  This riverlike motion of thousands of galaxies extends at least <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(40/h\ \rm Mpc\)</span> both upstream and downstream.  Astronomers would like to use this streaming to deduce the locations of the mass (visible or dark) capable of exerting such an immense gravitational tug.  The Hydra-Centaurus supercluster, which is in the direction of the flow is <em>not</em> responsible, since it too is moving along with the flow of the rest of the galaxies.  This implies that the source of the motion lies beyond that supercluster.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987ApJ...313L..37D/abstract">Dressler et al. (1987)</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJ...354...13D/abstract">Dressler &amp; Faber (1990)a</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJ...354L..45D/abstract">Dressler &amp; Faber (1990)b</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...368...54D/abstract">Dressler et al. (1991)</a> calculated the presence of a <strong><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Attractor">Great Attractor</a></strong> (GA), a diffuse collection of clusters spread over a wide <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((60^\circ)\)</span> region of the sky.  According to their calculations, the GA lies in the same plane as the Local Supercluster, which is about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(42/h\ \rm Mpc\)</span> away in the direction of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ell = 309^\circ,\ b=18^\circ\)</span> in the constellation Centaurus.</p>
<p>The mass of the Great Attractor is estimated to be about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2/h \times 10^{16}\ M_\odot\)</span>, but there are just <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7,500\)</span> galaxies known in that region (too few to account for so much mass).  This suggests that approximately <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(90\%\)</span> of the mass of the GA may be in the form of dark matter.  There could be a large hidden supercluster of galaxies in the direction of the GA because it lies behind the plane of our galaxy and is obscured by dust.  If so, it would be centered on a cluster of galaxies called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Cluster">Abell 3627</a>.</p>
<p>On the near side of the GA, the velocities exceed that of the unperturbed Hubble flow, where there are hints of a “back flow” of the farside of the GA (i.e., velocities less than the Hubble flow), but this has been disputed by other investigators (e.g., <a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ApJS...81..413M/abstract">Mathewson, Ford, &amp; Buchhorn (1992)</a>).  This dispute suggests that the velocity excess actually continues <em>beyond</em> the proposed location of the GA and other concentrations of matter.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the Great Attractor is not solely responsible for the large-scale streaming motion.  The <strong><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_Supercluster">Shapley concentration</a></strong> of galaxies is probably the most massive collection of galaxies in our neighborhood of the universe.  With a core consisting of a gravitationally bound concentration of some <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(20\)</span> rich galaxy clusters, the Shapley concentration has a mass of a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\sim}1/h \times 10^{16}\ M_\odot\)</span> and lies within <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^\circ\)</span> of the direction of the Local Group’s motion and very close to the direction of the GA.  However, the Shapley concentration’s distance is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\sim}3\times\)</span> the distance calculated for the Great Attractor, so it cannot be identified with the GA.  It is probably responsible for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10-15\%\)</span> fo the net acceleration of the Local Group.</p>
<p>The large-scale bulk motions cannot continue on increasingly larger scales because that would violate the cosmological principle that the universe is isotropic.  The direction such a large-scale bulk motion would be a preferred direction in the universe.  Observations based on Type Ia supernova distances indicate that these vas bulk flows eventually converge with the Hubble flow (with no peculiar velocity) at a distance of about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((50-60)/h\ \rm Mpc\)</span>.  Some observations using Type Ia supernovae fail to find any evidence at all of large-scale coherent motion!</p>

<p>To find how the universe looks when examined at even larger scales, extensive surveys of the sky have been conducted.</p>
<p>During the 1950s, the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey recorded the northern portion of the heavens on glass photographic plates (each covering a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6^\circ \times 6^\circ\)</span> area).  In this study, two plates were made for each area of sky that were more sensitive to either red or blue light, thus giving an indication of the temperatures of the objects photographed in addition to their relative brightnesses.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom’s Schmidt Telescope performed a survey of the southern skies and produced a map that displays some <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\)</span> million galaxies between apparent magnitudes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(17-20.5\)</span> that are found within <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4300\ \rm sq.\ degrees\)</span> centered on the south Galactic pole.  The map is not a photograph, rather each dot has an intensity that covers a range with zero (black) and 20 (white).  The galaxies are not randomly distributed across the sky.  The small, bright regions are clusters, and the longer, filamentary strands are superclusters.</p>
<p>The human eye and brain have a talent for finding patterns, even when none exist.  The difficulty is compounded by 2D depictions on the sky that give the illusion of patterns (e.g., constellations).  All of the galaxies are projected onto the plane of the sky, so true associations cannot be distinguished from line-of-sight coincidences.  Three-dimensional structures may be hidden or distorted when flattened into two dimensions.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, several groups of astronomers began making 3D maps of the universe by using the redshifts of galaxies and the Hubble law to provide the distance of the galaxies.  <strong>Redshift surveys</strong> revealed the existence of huge voids, which measure up to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100\ \rm Mpc\)</span> across and are vaguely spherical, rather than flattened like sheets occupied by superclusters.  The space inside a void is empty of bright spirals and ellipticals, although a few faint dwarf ellipticals may be present.</p>
<p>Most of the early surveys sampled just one area of the sky, so it was not possible to get an overall picture of the distribution of galaxies.  Surveys of wedge-shaped slices of the heavens shows where the empty regions are an dhow they relate to one another.  During a night’s observation, the rotation of the Earth carries a telescope through about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(9\)</span> hours of right ascension, and redshifts are measured for the galaxies that cross the telescope’s field of view.  This procedure is repeated until all of the galaxies in a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6^\circ\)</span> declination slice have been measured, out to a radial velocity of some <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(15,000\ \rm km/s\)</span>.</p>
<p>Two slices from the earliest surveys completed in 1985 show some patterns.  From the uncertainty of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_o\)</span> at the time, the distance is expressed in terms of a radial velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(cz\)</span> (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> is the measured redshift).  Each dot on the plots is a galaxy, where astronomer study the figures and try to imagine a 3D distribution of galaxies that would have these cross sections.</p>
<p>The galaxies are not randomly distributed, and the slices show that galaxies do not form a network of threadlike filaments that meander through space. If they did, then a slice would be much more likely to cut across a filament than along it.  There are simply too many connected features, and too few isolated clumps, for this to be true.</p>
<p>Consider a slice through a froth of soap bubbles, which would look very much like what is seen in the slices.  Galaxies that lie on 2D sheet that form walls of bubble-shaped regions of space and that inside the bubbles are huge voids.  One such large void is at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha = 15h,\ v= 7500\ \rm km/s\)</span> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((75/h\ \rm Mpc\ away)\)</span> and has a diameter of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5000\ \rm km/s\)</span> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((50/h\ \rm Mpc\ away)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Coma cluster appears as the torso of the humanlike figure at the center of each slice of the CfA redshift survey.  Apparently, rich clusters and superclusters that are found at the intersections of bubbles, and long structures like the Perseus-Pisces supercluster may lie along the surface of adjoining bubbles.  The filamentary features show where the slices through sheets of galaxies form the walls of the voids.</p>

<p>Another method of inferring the presence of large features is to use the available data to mathematically describe the clustering of galaxies.  If galaxies were uniformly distributed through space with a number density <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>, then the probability <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dP\)</span> of finding a galaxy within a volume <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dV\)</span> would be the same everywhere, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dP = ndV\)</span> (assuming that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dV\)</span> is sufficiently small that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dP \leq 1\)</span>).</p>

<p>As surveys (e.g., SDSS) sample more remote regions of space, the behavior of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_o\)</span> with sample depth <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_s\)</span> is of some interest.  If the universe has a fractal structure and is scale-free, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_o\)</span> should increase proportionally with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_s\)</span>.</p>

</ul>
<p>The search is underway to find the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_s\)</span> where the universe becomes homogenous. Although some studies have apparently found the transition to homogeneity, others have not.  There is general agreement that the universe has a fractal structure on scales out to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\approx 30/h\ \rm Mpc\)</span>.  This does <em>not</em> mean that the universe <em>is</em> a fractal, because self-similarity hold only for smaller scales and not for larger ones.</p>
<p>The prevailing view is that the transition to homogeneity occurs somewhere around (or past) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_s \approx 30/h\ \rm Mpc\)</span>, perhaps as far as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_s 200/h\ \rm Mpc\)</span>  This scale is consistent with the extent of the largest coherent structures in the universe, the cosmic network of interconnected filaments of galaxies that fill the universe.</p>
