    "### Unveiling the 3rd Dimension\n",
    "In 1761, the method of trigonometric parallax was used to measure the distance to Venus, thereby calibrating the size of Kepler's Solar System.  [Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Bessel) measured the subtle annual shift in the position of [61 Cygni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/61_Cygni) (in 1862), where he combined the parallax method with his knowledge with the measured size of Earth's orbit to discover that 61 Cyg is ${\\sim}650,000\\ \\rm AU$ away (or ${\\sim}10\\ \\rm ly$; $1\\ {\\rm ly} = 63,241\\ {\\rm AU}$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the surveyor's method of trigonometric parallax can reach out past the Galactic center, or to ${\\sim}9.2\\ \\rm kpc$ with the [Gaia telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)).  Another method of distance determination was with the moving cluster method that made it possible to determine the distance to the Hyades cluster.  The technique of main-sequence fitting (or spectroscopic parallax) can be used to find the distances to open clusters out to about $7\\ \\rm kpc$ by comparing their main sequences on an H-R diagram with that of the Hyades cluster.  The repeated application of a variety of methods using this pattern of calibration and measurement constitutes the steps of the **extragalactic distance scale**, or the *cosmological distance ladder*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Wilson-Bappu Effect\n",
    "Spectroscopic parallax can (in principle) provide reliable distances to remote stars out to ${\\sim}7\\ \\rm Mpc$ away, although in practice it is employed with in a few $100\\ \\rm kpc$ and is far enough to reach the Magellanic Clouds.  Some stars have specific feature in their spectra that allow their absolute magnitudes (and hence their distances) to be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the K absorption line of $\\rm Ca$ can be quite broad, reaching maximum strength at spectral type $\\rm K0$.  In late-type stars with chromospheres (e.g., $G,\\ K,\\ \\text{and } M$ spectral types), a narrow emission line is seen, centered on the wide K absorption line.  The width of this emission line is strongly correlated with a star's absolute visual magnitude, valid over a range of $15$ magnitudes, and called the **Wilson-Bappu effect** ([Wilson & Vainu Bappu (1957)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1957ApJ...125..661W/abstract)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cepheid Distance Scale\n",
    "For more distant objects, astronomers turn to the [period-luminosity relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period-luminosity_relation) for Cepheids.  Before this relation could be used, it had to be calibrated by finding a classical Cepheid.  The nearest one (Polaris) was too far away (${\\sim}200\\ \\rm pc$) for trigonometric parallax to be useful when the first calibrations were being performed in the early 20th century.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1913, Ejnar Hertzsprung used the Sun's motion of $16.5\\ \\rm km/s$ with respect to the LSR to provide a longer baseline for parallax measurements.  It was this technique of [secular parallax](https://saturnaxis.github.io/Cosmology/Chapter_25/milky-way-galaxy.html#some-methods-for-determining-distances) that enabled him to determine the average distance to a classical Cepheid with a period of $6.6\\ \\rm days$.  Hertzsprung then used this information to calibrate the period-luminosity relation, where Shapley carried out a similar procedure.  The distances to more Cepheids have been measured by parallax and other methods since then, and the period-luminosity relation has become well established.  Astronomer today use a period-luminosity relation in the form ([Marengo et al. (2010)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/709/1/120/pdf))\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "M_V = \\alpha\\left[\\log_{10} P -1.0 \\right] + \\beta,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta$ accounts for the finite width of the instability strip on the H-R diagram.  Carroll & Ostlie (2007) use $\\alpha = -3.53$ and $\\beta = 2.13(B-V) - 5.66$, where Marengo et al. (2010) use $\\alpha = -3.37 \\pm 0.06$ and $\\beta = -5.65 \\pm 0.02$ in the K band.  In both cases, $P$ is the pulsation period in units of days, where $B-V$ refers to the color index.  For classical Cepheids $B-V\\approx 0.4\\text{ to } 1.1$.  After the star's absolute magnitude has been calculated, it can be combined with the star's apparent magnitude to give its distance modulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cepheid variable stars immediately proved their worth as stellar yardsticks.  It was in 1917 that Shapley measured the distances to Pop II Cepheids in globular clusters, thereby determining his estimates for the diameter of the Galaxy and the distance of the Sun from its center.  In 1923, Edwin Hubble discovered several Cepheid in M31 and announced that it was $285\\ \\rm kpc$ away.  It was Hubble's series of observations that established M31 as an external galaxy, not a smaller nebula within the borders of the Milky Way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of a correlation between a Cepheid's pulsation period and it absolute magnitude meant that these stars could be used as standard candles to determine distances many years *before* the physical processes that cause the pulsations were understood.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the time, it was not known that 3 types of pulsating stars were used to determine the size of the Galaxy and the distance to M31.  Although the existence of interstellar dust clouds had been established, the existence of diffuse interstellar dust and gas capable of extinguishing starlight had not yet been demonstrated.  Leavitt's variables in the Magellanic Clouds were classical Cepheids (Pop I stars), while those observed in the globular clusters by Shapely were W Virginis and RR Lyrae stars (both Pop II).\n",
    "\n",
    "The W Viriginis stars are about $1.5\\ \\text{mag}$ fainter than classical Cepheids of the same period, which corresponds to a lower luminosity by a factor of 4.  After Hertzsprung and (later) Shapley calibrated the period-luminosity relation, they used nearby classical Cepheids but neglected the effect of extinction.  Neither realized that dust in the Galactic disk dimmed these stars by (coincidentally) about $1.5\\ \\text{mag}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By chance the resulting period-luminosity relation was just about right when used with W Virginis stars.  However, it would give an underluminous result with classical Cepheids.  When Hubble used this calibration to determine the distance to M31, the apparent magnitudes of his Cepheids were correct but his estimates of the absolute magnitudes were too large.  Consequently, their distance module $(m-M)$ and the distances themselves were underestimated.  The stars were thought to be **dimmer and closer** rather than *brighter and farther away*, and so their parent galaxies were measured at roughly 1/2 of their actual distances **and** half their actual sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapley fared no better with his observations of the (unknown to him) W Virginis stars in the globular clusters.  Although he unwittingly used the right variety of star for the calibration of the period-luminosity relation.  Extinction due to dust within the Galactic disk dimmed the starlight and increased the stars' apparent magnitudes.  Because the importance of extinction was not yet recognized, Shapely incorrectly attributed his stars' faintness to their remoteness.  As a result, his distances to the globular clusters were too great, as was the size he calculated for the Galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something was obviously wrong.  It appeared that the Milky Way was much larger than any of the galaxies surveyed.  [Trumpler (1930)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1930LicOB..14..154T/abstract) showed that interstellar extinction could remedy part of the problem.  The rest of the puzzle was solved by [Baade (1956)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1956PASP...68....5B/abstract), who showed that there are two types of Cepheids: (1) the classical Cepheids and (2) the intrinsically fainter W Virginis stars.  With these corrections, the measured distances and sizes of the other galaxies doubled and the Milky Way was reduced to a size that was a bit smaller than M31.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1990s, the calibration of the period-luminosity relation was carried out using data obtained by the Hipparcos mission.  Hipparcos astronomers measured the parallax angles of 273 Cepheids and used the resulting distances to derive the period-luminosity relation.  This was the first period-luminosity relation obtained from a direct distance measurement, and it is interesting that the result was nearly identical to an expression obtained by [Sandage & Tammann (1968)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1968ApJ...151..531S/abstract).  Although further adjustments are sure to follow Cepheids certainly provide a firm foundation measuring the distances to other galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interstellar extinction is still the largest source of error when Cepheids are used as standard candles, and there may also be a weak dependence on metallicity.  The extinction problem can be reduced by observing these stars at IR wavelengths, since IR light more readily penetrates dusty regions.  Because Cepheids are about $3\\times$ dimmer in the IR, astronomers have not stopped searching for them at visible wavelengths.\n",

    "### Supernovae as Distance Indicators\n",
    "Supernovae can be used in several ways to measure extragalactic distances.  Suppose the angular extent $\\theta(t)$ of a supernova's photosphere is observed.  The angular velocity of the expanding gases $\\omega\\ (=\\Delta \\theta/\\Delta t)$ can be found by comparing two observations separated by a time $\\Delta t$.  If $d$ is the distance to the supernova, then the transverse velocity of the expanding photosphere is $v_\\theta = \\omega d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the expansion is spherically symmetric, the transverse velocity should be equal to the ejecta's radial velocity $v_{\\rm ej}$ obtained from the supernova's Doppler-shifted spectral lines.  Then the distance to the supernova is $d= v_{\\rm ej}/\\omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most supernovae are too distant for the above method to be employed, where another strategy is adopted.  It assumes that the expanding shell of hot gases radiates as a blackbody.  Then the supernova's luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L = 4\\pi \\sigma R^2(t)T_{e}^4, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R(t)$ is the radius of the expanding photosphere and $t$ is the age of the supernova.  If we assume that the ejecta's radial velocity has remained nearly constant, then $R(t) = v_{\\rm ej}t$.  The effective temperature $T_e$ of the photosphere comes from the characteristics of its blackbody spectrum.  Once the luminosity is found, it can be converted to an absolute magnitude and then used to find the distance to the supernova by comparing it with the apparent magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The photosphere of the expanding shell of a supernova is neither perfectly spherical nor a perfect blackbody.  Difficulties with accurate values for interstellar extinction plague both methods, but the problem is more acute for core-collapse supernovae (Types Ib, Ic, and II), which are found near sites of recent star formation.  Typical uncertainties in the distances obtained range from $15-25\\%$ for M101 to the Virgo cluster of galaxies, respectively.\n",

    "From the sizes of their expanding photospheres, novae can be used in the same manner as supernovae to determine distances.  Although there is a wide variation in the absolute magnitudes of novae at peak light, there is a relation between a nova's maximum visual magnitude $M_v^{\\rm max}$ and the time it takes for its visible light to decline by two magnitudes.  *Consequently, novae can serve as standard candles.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical reason why this relationship holds for novae is that more massive, smaller white dwarfs produce greater compression and heating of the accreted gases on their surfaces.  A runaway thermonuclear reaction may be initiated with a smaller accumulated mass.  The less massive surface layers are more readily ejected, and the nova declines more rapidly.  The average rate of decline over the first $2\\ \\rm mag$ is written as $\\dot{m}$ (in $\\rm mag/day$) and can be expressed as\n",

    "Measurements of the angular sizes of the H II regions and the apparent magnitude of the galaxy can be compared with similar measurements for other galaxies with known distances.  This makes it possible to calculate the H II regions' linear sizes (in $\\rm pc$), along with the galaxy's absolute magnitude.  However, since the diameter of an H II region is difficult to define unambiguously, this procedure is relatively insensitive to distance and must be used carefully.\n",

    "## The Expansion of the Universe\n",
    "In the early 1900s, astronomers began making systematic observations of the galactic radial velocities by measuring their Doppler-shifted spectral lines.  It was hoped that if the motions of these objects were found to be random, then the Sun's motion in the Milky Wya should be related to the vector sum of the radial velocities of the spiral nebulae.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was [Vesto Slipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesto_M._Slipher) who first discovered that this plan was doomed to failure.  The velocities of the spiral nebulae were *not* random.  Instead, most of the spectra showed redshifted spectral lines.  Slipher announced in 1914 that most of the 12 galaxies he surveyed were rapidly moving *away* from Earth, although M31's blueshifted spectrum indicated it was approaching Earth at nearly $300\\ \\rm km/s$.  It was quickly realized that these galaxies were not *only* moving away from Earth but moving away from each other as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Astronomers began to talk about these galactic motions in terms of an expansion.  Meanwhile, Slipher continuted his measurements, and by 1925, he had examined $40$ galaxies with spectra showing redshifted lines were much more common than those exhibiting blueshifts.  Slipher concluded that nearly every galaxy he examined was rapidly receding from Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hubble's Law of Universal Expansion\n",
    "In 1925, Hubble discovered Cepheid variable stars in M31, which established that the Andromeda \"nebula\" was in fact an external galaxy.  Hubble continued his search for Cepheids, while determining the distances to $18$ galaxies.  He combined his results with Slipher's velocities and discovered tha a galaxy's recessional velocity $v$ was proportional to its distance $d$.  In 1929, Hubble presented his results in a paper at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences ([Hubble (1929)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1929PNAS...15..168H/abstract)), which included the relation,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "v = H_o d.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "This relation is today called **Hubble's law**, where the proportionality constant is called the **Hubble constant** $H_o$.  The recessional velocity is usually given in $\\rm km/s$ and the distance $d$ in $\\rm Mpc$, so Hubble's constant $H_o$ has units of $\\rm km/s/Mpc$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hubble realized that he had discovered an exceptionally powerful method of finding distance to remote galaxies simply by measuring their redshifts.  his early results show a linear fit to a scattering of points on a graph of velocity $v$ vs. distance $d$.  Hubble continued to compile distances and redshifts to strengthen this relationship, with much of the work done my his assistant, [Milton Humason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_L._Humason).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Humason literally worked his up to the top at Mt. Wilson Observatory, where he started out as a mule packer when the observatory was begin constructed.  Then, he served as a restaurant busboy, janitor, and night assistant at Mt. Wilson.  After Humason gained permission to observe on the smaller telescopes, Hubble was so impressed with the results that Humason ended up as his assistant.  Humason exposed and measured most of the photographic plates himself.  By 1934, the distances and velocities of $32$ galaxies were obtained and the expansion of the universe became an observational feature of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the idea of a universal expansion was simultaneously being developed by theorists.  [Willem de Sitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Sitter) used Einstein's theory of general relativity to describe a universe that was **expanding**.  Although de Sitter's solution of Einstein's equations described a vacuum (universe devoid of matter), it did predict a redshift that increased with the distance from the light's origin.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hubble was aware of de Sitter's work, where Hubble referenced the expansion ast the de Sitter effect.  Other theorists later found additional solutions that also indicated a universal expansion, but astronomers were unaware of their results until 1930.  Einstein himself initially favored a *static* universe that was neither expanding nor contracting.  However, the observations of Hubble and Humason forced Einstein to abandon this view in 1930.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Expansion of Space and the Hubble Flow\n",
    "To understand what *the expansion of the universe* really means, suppose that the Earth were to expand, doubling in size during an hour's time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, Yellowstone National Park is $500\\ \\rm km$ from Salt Lake City; Albuquerque is $1000\\ \\rm km$ away; and Minneapolis is at $2000\\ \\rm km$.  An hour later, each of these distances have doubled (e.g., Yellowstone is now $1000\\ \\rm km$) so that a Salt Lake City resident would find Yellowstone drifted away at $500\\ \\rm km/hr$, Albuquerque moved away at $1000\\ \\rm km/hr$, and Minneapolis receded at $2000\\ \\rm km/hr$.  Thus a recessional velocity that is proportional to distance is the natural result of an expansion that is both **isotropic** and **homogenous** (i.e., same in magnitude in every direction and at every location).  Observers in yellow stone, Albuquerque, and Minneapolis would arrive at the same conclusion.  Everyone involved in the expansion sees everyone else moving away with a velocity that obey's Hubble's law.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a vital distinction between the velocity of a galaxy through space (i.e., **peculiar velocity**) and its **recessional velocity** due to the expansion of the universe.  A galaxy's recessional velocity is *not* due to its motion through space; instead the galaxy is being *carried* along with the surrounding space as the universe expands.  The motion of galaxies as they participate in the expansion of the universe is the **Hubble flow**.  In the same manner, a galaxy's **cosmological redshift** is produced by the expansion as the wavelength of the light emitted by the galaxy is stretched along with the space through which the light travels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the cosmological redshift is not related to the galaxy's recessional velocity by the Doppler shift equations.  Those equations were derived for a static, *Euclidean* spacetime and do not include the effects of the expanding, *curved* spacetime of our universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, astronomers frequently translate a measured redshift $z$ into a radial velocity that a galaxy would have *if* it had a peculiar velocity instead of its actual recessional velocity.  For example, the statement that *quasar SDSS 1030+0524 appears to be moving away from us at more than $96\\%$ of the speed of light* must be interpreted with the above caveat in mind.  For $z \\leq 2$, the distance estimate obtained using Hubble's law ([Davis & Lineweaver (2004)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PASA...21...97D/abstract)),\n",

    "- Thus the sizes of atoms, planetary systems, and galaxies have *not* changed because of the expansion of space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Value of the Hubble Constant\n",
    "In principle, Hubble's law can be used to find the distance to any galaxy whose redshift can be measured.  The stumbling block to carrying out this procedure has been the uncertainty in the [Hubble constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law).  Through the end of the 20th century, $H_o$ was known within a factor of two, between $50-100\\ \\rm km/s/Mpc$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, the difficulty in determining the value of $H_o$ arose from using remote galaxies for its calibration.  A major source of the diverse values of $H_o$ obtained by different researchers lay in their choice (and ues) of secondary distance indicators when measuring remote galaxies.  There are also large-scale motions of galaxies relative to the Hubble flow that are being sorted out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there is a selection effect called a [Malmquist bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malmquist_bias) that must be guarded against.  This can occur when using a magnitude-limited sample of objects, where objects brighter than a certain *apparent* magnitude are used.  At larger distances, only the intrinsically brightest objects will be included in the sample, which will skew the statistics unless corrected for.\n",
    "\n",
    "To incorporate the uncertainty in $H_o$, it is defined using a dimensionless parameter $h$ through the expression, \n",

    "- Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) using WMAP, X-ray sources using Chandra, and optical surveys using HST (all before 2010) suggested that $H_o \\approx 73\\ \\rm km/s/Mpc$, which implies $h = 0.73$.\n",
    "- However, measurements from the Planck mission from $2013-2018$ indicated that $H_o = 67.66 \\pm 0.42\\ \\rm km/s/Mpc$.  \n",
    "- In $2018-2019$, astronomers based their measurement on information from gravitational wave events to determine Hubble's constant, which resulted in $H_o = 73.3^{+5.3}_{-5.0}\\ \\rm km/s/Mpc$ ([Chen et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018Natur.562..545C)).\n",

Even at this distance, M31 is about $2.5^\\circ$ wide on the sky or five time the Moon's diameter.  In addition to the Magellanic Clouds, $9$ of the dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals are situated near the Milky Way.  All $3$ spiral galaxies have warped disks.  In fact, the line of sight from Earth passes twice through some parts of the disk of M33.\n",

Thus, the mass-to-light ratio is estimated to be $M/L = 57\\ M_\\odot/L_\\odot$.  Because the value of $P$ was overestimated, $M/L$ has been underestimated.

    "### The Existence of Superclusters\n",
    "Next in the hierarchy of galactic clustering is the **supercluster**, which is a clustering of clusters on a scale of up to about $100\\ \\rm Mpc$.  The Virgo cluster is near the center of the **Local Supercluster**.  This disk of clusters has the shape of a flattened ellipsoid (i.e., a pancake) that contains most of the galaxies lying within about $20\\ \\rm Mpc$ of the Virgo cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the most prominent superclusters are the Perseus-Pisces and the Hydra-Centaurus supercluster, which are named for the constellations in which it is found.  The Perseus-Pisces supercluster is about $50/h\\ \\rm Mpc$ away and has a threadlike appearance.  It is a planar, filamentary structure that is about $40/h\\ \\rm Mpc$ long.  The Hydra-Centaurus supercluster is at $30/h\\ \\rm Mpc$ in roughly the opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Local Group resides near the edge of the Local Supercluster, it might be expected that the supercluster's gravitational pull would be detectable.  In 1958, de Vaucouleurs found that the Local Group is moving away less rapidly from the Virgo cluster than would be expected solely from the expansion of the universe.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At a distance of $16\\ \\rm Mpc$, a pure Hubble flow would produce a recessional velocity of $v= H_od = 1600/h\\ \\rm km/s$.  The difference between the actual velocity of the Local Group relative to the Virgo cluster and the Hubble flow is called the **Virgocentric peculiar velocity** of the Local Group and is estimated to be $168 \\pm 50\\ \\rm km/s$ [(Sandage & Tammann (1990))](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJ...365....1S/abstract).\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar argument used for the approaching paths of the Milky Way and M31 can now be invoked to estimate the mass-to-light ratio of the Local Supercluster.  The results show that the supercluster's mass is ${\\sim}8/h \\times 10^{14}\\ M_\\odot$.  The corresponding mass-to light ratio is $M/L \\simeq 400/h\\ M_\\odot/L_\\odot$, which provides more evidence for a preponderance ($>50%$ probability) of dark matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large-scale Motions Relative to the Hubble Flow\n",
    "The Virgocentric peculiar velocity is a minor perturbation in a much larger scale inhomogeneity in the Hubble flow.  There is a large-scale streaming motion (relative to the Hubble flow) that carries the Milky Way, the Local Group, the Virgo cluster, and thousands of other galaxies through space in the direction of the constellation Centaurus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The peculiar velocity of the Local Group relative to the Hubble flow is $627\\ \\rm km/s$.  This riverlike motion of thousands of galaxies extends at least $40/h\\ \\rm Mpc$ both upstream and downstream.  Astronomers would like to use this streaming to deduce the locations of the mass (visible or dark) capable of exerting such an immense gravitational tug.  The Hydra-Centaurus supercluster, which is in the direction of the flow is *not* responsible, since it too is moving along with the flow of the rest of the galaxies.  This implies that the source of the motion lies beyond that supercluster.\n",

    "[Dressler et al. (1987)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987ApJ...313L..37D/abstract), [Dressler & Faber (1990)a](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJ...354...13D/abstract), [Dressler & Faber (1990)b](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJ...354L..45D/abstract), and [Dressler et al. (1991)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...368...54D/abstract) calculated the presence of a **[Great Attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Attractor)** (GA), a diffuse collection of clusters spread over a wide $(60^\\circ)$ region of the sky.  According to their calculations, the GA lies in the same plane as the Local Supercluster, which is about $42/h\\ \\rm Mpc$ away in the direction of $\\ell = 309^\\circ,\\ b=18^\\circ$ in the constellation Centaurus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The mass of the Great Attractor is estimated to be about $2/h \\times 10^{16}\\ M_\\odot$, but there are just $7,500$ galaxies known in that region (too few to account for so much mass).  This suggests that approximately $90\\%$ of the mass of the GA may be in the form of dark matter.  There could be a large hidden supercluster of galaxies in the direction of the GA because it lies behind the plane of our galaxy and is obscured by dust.  If so, it would be centered on a cluster of galaxies called [Abell 3627](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Cluster).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the near side of the GA, the velocities exceed that of the unperturbed Hubble flow, where there are hints of a \"back flow\" of the farside of the GA (i.e., velocities less than the Hubble flow), but this has been disputed by other investigators (e.g., [Mathewson, Ford, & Buchhorn (1992)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ApJS...81..413M/abstract)).  This dispute suggests that the velocity excess actually continues *beyond* the proposed location of the GA and other concentrations of matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possibility is that the Great Attractor is not solely responsible for the large-scale streaming motion.  The **[Shapley concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_Supercluster)** of galaxies is probably the most massive collection of galaxies in our neighborhood of the universe.  With a core consisting of a gravitationally bound concentration of some $20$ rich galaxy clusters, the Shapley concentration has a mass of a ${\\sim}1/h \\times 10^{16}\\ M_\\odot$ and lies within $10^\\circ$ of the direction of the Local Group's motion and very close to the direction of the GA.  However, the Shapley concentration's distance is ${\\sim}3\\times$ the distance calculated for the Great Attractor, so it cannot be identified with the GA.  It is probably responsible for $10-15\\%$ fo the net acceleration of the Local Group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The large-scale bulk motions cannot continue on increasingly larger scales because that would violate the cosmological principle that the universe is isotropic.  The direction such a large-scale bulk motion would be a preferred direction in the universe.  Observations based on Type Ia supernova distances indicate that these vas bulk flows eventually converge with the Hubble flow (with no peculiar velocity) at a distance of about $(50-60)/h\\ \\rm Mpc$.  Some observations using Type Ia supernovae fail to find any evidence at all of large-scale coherent motion!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bubbles and Voids: Structure on the Largest Scales\n",
    "To find how the universe looks when examined at even larger scales, extensive surveys of the sky have been conducted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "During the 1950s, the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey recorded the northern portion of the heavens on glass photographic plates (each covering a $6^\\circ \\times 6^\\circ$ area).  In this study, two plates were made for each area of sky that were more sensitive to either red or blue light, thus giving an indication of the temperatures of the objects photographed in addition to their relative brightnesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The United Kingdom's Schmidt Telescope performed a survey of the southern skies and produced a map that displays some $2$ million galaxies between apparent magnitudes $17-20.5$ that are found within $4300\\ \\rm sq.\\ degrees$ centered on the south Galactic pole.  The map is not a photograph, rather each dot has an intensity that covers a range with zero (black) and 20 (white).  The galaxies are not randomly distributed across the sky.  The small, bright regions are clusters, and the longer, filamentary strands are superclusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The human eye and brain have a talent for finding patterns, even when none exist.  The difficulty is compounded by 2D depictions on the sky that give the illusion of patterns (e.g., constellations).  All of the galaxies are projected onto the plane of the sky, so true associations cannot be distinguished from line-of-sight coincidences.  Three-dimensional structures may be hidden or distorted when flattened into two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1980s, several groups of astronomers began making 3D maps of the universe by using the redshifts of galaxies and the Hubble law to provide the distance of the galaxies.  **Redshift surveys** revealed the existence of huge voids, which measure up to $100\\ \\rm Mpc$ across and are vaguely spherical, rather than flattened like sheets occupied by superclusters.  The space inside a void is empty of bright spirals and ellipticals, although a few faint dwarf ellipticals may be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the early surveys sampled just one area of the sky, so it was not possible to get an overall picture of the distribution of galaxies.  Surveys of wedge-shaped slices of the heavens shows where the empty regions are an dhow they relate to one another.  During a night's observation, the rotation of the Earth carries a telescope through about $9$ hours of right ascension, and redshifts are measured for the galaxies that cross the telescope's field of view.  This procedure is repeated until all of the galaxies in a $6^\\circ$ declination slice have been measured, out to a radial velocity of some $15,000\\ \\rm km/s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two slices from the earliest surveys completed in 1985 show some patterns.  From the uncertainty of $H_o$ at the time, the distance is expressed in terms of a radial velocity $cz$ ($z$ is the measured redshift).  Each dot on the plots is a galaxy, where astronomer study the figures and try to imagine a 3D distribution of galaxies that would have these cross sections.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The galaxies are not randomly distributed, and the slices show that galaxies do not form a network of threadlike filaments that meander through space. If they did, then a slice would be much more likely to cut across a filament than along it.  There are simply too many connected features, and too few isolated clumps, for this to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a slice through a froth of soap bubbles, which would look very much like what is seen in the slices.  Galaxies that lie on 2D sheet that form walls of bubble-shaped regions of space and that inside the bubbles are huge voids.  One such large void is at $\\alpha = 15h,\\ v= 7500\\ \\rm km/s$ $(75/h\\ \\rm Mpc\\ away)$ and has a diameter of $5000\\ \\rm km/s$ $(50/h\\ \\rm Mpc\\ away)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Coma cluster appears as the torso of the humanlike figure at the center of each slice of the CfA redshift survey.  Apparently, rich clusters and superclusters that are found at the intersections of bubbles, and long structures like the Perseus-Pisces supercluster may lie along the surface of adjoining bubbles.  The filamentary features show where the slices through sheets of galaxies form the walls of the voids.\n",

    "<!-- Update this section on redshift surveys -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantifying Large-scale Structure\n",
    "Another method of inferring the presence of large features is to use the available data to mathematically describe the clustering of galaxies.  If galaxies were uniformly distributed through space with a number density $n$, then the probability $dP$ of finding a galaxy within a volume $dV$ would be the same everywhere, $dP = ndV$ (assuming that $dV$ is sufficiently small that $dP \\leq 1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, galaxies are not scattered about randomly.  The probability of finding a galaxy within a volume $dV$ at a distance $r$ from a specified galaxy then becomes\n",

    "dP = n\\left[1+\\xi(r)\\right]dV,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "which depends on the the number density of galaxies $n$ and a *two-point correlation function* $\\xi(r)$ that describes whether the galaxies are more concentrated $(\\xi > 0)$ or more dispersed $(\\xi <0)$ than average.  For $118,149$ galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and separations of $0.1/h\\ {\\rm Mpc} < r < 16/h\\ {\\rm Mpc}$, the **correlation function** is observed to be of the form\n",

    "\n",
    "As surveys (e.g., SDSS) sample more remote regions of space, the behavior of $r_o$ with sample depth $R_s$ is of some interest.  If the universe has a fractal structure and is scale-free, then $r_o$ should increase proportionally with $R_s$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the universe looks essentially the same at all scales, then deeper observations must reveal ever larger versions of smaller structures.\n",
    "- However, the cosmological principle requires $r_o$ become constant for sufficiently deep samples, because beyond some $R_s$ there are no larger structures to be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search is underway to find the value of $R_s$ where the universe becomes homogenous. Although some studies have apparently found the transition to homogeneity, others have not.  There is general agreement that the universe has a fractal structure on scales out to $\\approx 30/h\\ \\rm Mpc$.  This does *not* mean that the universe *is* a fractal, because self-similarity hold only for smaller scales and not for larger ones.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The prevailing view is that the transition to homogeneity occurs somewhere around (or past) $R_s \\approx 30/h\\ \\rm Mpc$, perhaps as far as $R_s 200/h\\ \\rm Mpc$  This scale is consistent with the extent of the largest coherent structures in the universe, the cosmic network of interconnected filaments of galaxies that fill the universe."
